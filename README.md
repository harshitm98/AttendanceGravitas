# Attendance GraVITas
This is simply just a product of how crappy the graVITas website is.

### Steps
1. In `bot.py` replace `email-id`, `password` and `event-id`.
2. Download the attendance google sheet provided by gravitas with present marked by 'p' and rename it to `attendance.xlsx`
3. Activate the virtual environment and then run `bot.py`
